<h3>Horiseon Website Refactoring Assignment</h3>

The marketing agency horiseon has employed me to help refactor their websites code, fix any impending issues/bugs within the website and also add accesibilty for anyone with diabilities trying to use their website.

To begin with, I looked at the way the HTML was structured, and began to add proper semantics to make it easier for the website to read and format, aswell as anyone else veiwing the code. I added a title element to the page, and cleaned up the NAV bar and added Nav elements instead of standard div elements. I then added the section element to the main paragraphs of writing, as well as an aside elemenet to the side bar. I also added a footer element for the footer. I added hidden comments that only show in the code, so when viewed by the owners of the website, they can understand what each section applies to. Lastly I added alt comments to images, so they can be describes if the images arent able to be veiwed.

I then looked at all the CSS coding within Visual Studio Code. Many aspects of the code were repeated unneccisarily, making the coding look sloppy and hard to read. For example, the heading Benefit-Lead, Benefit-brand and Benefit-cost all had the same margin of 10px and text to be aligned to the center. This was unnecisarily repeated 3 times, when the classes could have been written together, and 1 set of instructions could be given to each of them.

The refactored website is now more accessible and in a much better working condition. It is fully functional, and behind the scenes, the code is much neater and easier to read for future tweaks and changes. Ive learnt a neater and more efficient way to code, by veiwing mistakes another developer has made and have also gotten my hands dirty with problem solving and editing code. Being able to work around an already functional website and make changes/fixes to it has sharpened my skills in coding, as well as given me more confidence by reading a more complex code then to that of the activities dealt with in class.
